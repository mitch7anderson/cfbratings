cfbratings is a package that provides rating methods for college
football teams. Using statistical methods, cfbratings produces different
ratings metrics for analyzing and comparing college football teams using
in-season data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of cfbratings from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mitch7anderson/cfbratings")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(cfbratings)
## basic example code
```

## To Do

In future iterations I would like to finish implementing my ratings
functions, add a vignette on using cfbratings with the cfbfastr package,
complete the testing suite for my code, and potentially implement a
strength of schedule metric.
